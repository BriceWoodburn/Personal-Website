# Personal Portfolio
A personal portfolio website built to showcase my projects, skills, and background as a software developer.

## Overview
This personal portfolio serves as a central place to explore who I am as a developer and what I enjoy building. It highlights my projects, technical skills, and experience through a user-friendly, and responsive design.

## Features
- **Project Showcase:**
  - Detailed project cards with descriptions, tech stacks, and links to live demos and GitHub repositories.
- **Skills Section:**
  - Organized and visually structured skill groups highlighting the tools, languages, and frameworks I use.
- **Interactive UI elements:**
  - Subtle animations, hover effects, and transitions to enhance user experience without distraction.
- **Responsive Design**
  - Fully responsive layout optimized for any screen size.

## Motivation
I built this website to create a professional space that represents both my technical abilities and my personality as a developer. Rather than relying solely on resumes or online profiles, I wanted a place to showcase my work in more detail and allow visitors to better understand me beyond a traditional resume. This project has been an ongoing opportunity to refine my frontend skills, improve UI/UX decisions, and present my work in a meaningful way.
